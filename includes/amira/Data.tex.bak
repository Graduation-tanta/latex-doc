Our work relies on three types of data:
 \begin{enumerate}
     \item \textbf{Wikipedia} that serves as our knowledge source for finding
     answers.
     \item \textbf{SQuAD} dataset which is our main resource to train
     Document Reader.
     \item three more \textbf{QA} datasets (\textbf{CuratedTREC}, 
     \textbf{WebQuestions} and \textbf{WikiMovies})that in addition to SQuAD,
     are used to test the open-domain QA abilities of our full system, and to
     evaluate the ability of our model to learn 
     from multitask learning and distant supervision.
 \end{enumerate}
  \subsection{Wikipedia (Knowledge Source)}
  We use the dump \cite{web021} of English Wikipedia for all of our full-
  scale experiments as the knowledge source used to answer questions. For
  each page, only the plain text is extracted and all structured data
  sections such as lists and figures are stripped \cite{web022}.After
  discarding internal disambiguation, list, index, and outline pages, we
  retain 5,075,182 articles consisting of 9,008,962 unique uncased token
  types.

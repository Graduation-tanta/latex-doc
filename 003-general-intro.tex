With the recent breakthrough in computer technologies ranging from faster hardware, broadband networks and very large amounts of data to artificial intelligence algorithms through deep learning, opening new horizon for intelligent applications i.e. personal assistants, self-driving cars and chatbots for any e-commerce application or business.

In this project we implement an open domain question answering system that considers the entire Wikipedia as a knowledge source through a search engine(which can be adapted to any knowledge source) as well as an information extraction deep learning model that's capable of reading comprehension.

This is based on a recent work \cite{P17-1171} proposed from \Ac{FAIR}, considering open domain question answering setting.
